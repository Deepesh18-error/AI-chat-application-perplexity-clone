    API endpoint to receive a user prompt.

    processing pipeline. In Stage 1, its only responsibility is to
    confirm that it has received the prompt from the frontend.

        request: The Django HttpRequest object. The user's prompt is
                 expected in the request body as JSON: {"prompt": "..."}.
